            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>“F#@% THE MARGINS”</h1><p>Walking into the Shamballa Eyewear suite at Vision Expo was an experience in itself. Blocked off by a red velvet rope, we realized this eyewear was a luxury to be craved. The set-up wasn’t pretty just to be pretty. This suite was an extension not only of theShamballa Eyewear brand, but Larry Sands himself.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Don't Be Afraid to Lose Control</h1><p>Well the boys from Wharton sure have accomplished something in five short years. What was once a no-name upstart, offering cheaply-priced glasses, has become one of the most recognized brands in the world of eyewear. With a current market valuation topping $1.2 billion dollars. Warby got there by smartly targeting today's most desirable demographic group: Millennials - ages 16 to 36. This generation literally grew up with computers, with the internet woven into the base pairs of their DNA and are clearly the current masters of the latest smartphones and tablets.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have been in the industry in this city for over 10 years and I kinda know just about everyone at each office. Some better than others. My lab called me one day last week and said that he had run out of pads for the edger. He had ordered them and they have just not arrived yet. I know that another office in the area has the same edger as we do.... So I called him, asked if we could buy some off him... He said he would just give us a roll and someday we can repay the favor. I was blown away by his kindness and the fact that he didn't even hesitate to help his competition. It reminded me that asking never hurts and the answer can be better that what you expected.</p>]]></description>
