            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, a client called me “relentless” and I took it as a compliment. His wife was purchasing sunglasses and he has been happy with his two pairs of new glasses he picked up before the new year. She pulled out of her purse a personalized, handwritten thank you note with a $25 gift certificate that we had sent her husband. He joked that he couldn’t remember the last time he had received a handwritten thank you note in the mail! He shrugged and admitted that our persistence paid off because here they were... back for more glasses!</p>]]></description>
