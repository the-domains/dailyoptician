I have been in the industry in this city for over 10 years and I kinda know just about everyone at each office. Some better than others. My lab called me one day last week and said that he had run out of pads for the edger. He had ordered them and they have just not arrived yet. I know that another office in the area has the same edger as we do.... So I called him, asked if we could buy some off him... He said he would just give us a roll and someday we can repay the favor. I was blown away by his kindness and the fact that he didn't even hesitate to help his competition. It reminded me that asking never hurts and the answer can be better that what you expected.
