When you retire and go to that lake house retreat you have been keeping a secret, what will be your lasting contribution to this profession you have been so passionate about for all these years. You chose to be an Optician because you got something out of it. Something that made you come back day after day, week after week and year after year. The reward... you loved the personal interaction, maybe or the technical science of eyecare and eyewear or the social relationships you fostered. But.... what will you give BACK?

What will you leave to make this profession "better" or "stronger" or more "respected"? Think about it and look in the mirror and ask yourself, "What can I give back?" Think about it.
