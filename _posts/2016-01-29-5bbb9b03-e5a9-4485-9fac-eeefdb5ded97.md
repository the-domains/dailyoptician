I have so many clients that choose a great frame and then bring a friend or family member in to see it and that person doesn't like it so it shoots down the client.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5235b0b6-8f41-4ae0-8d11-8f1f82f6cd69.jpg)

My advice to my clients is simply if they like it, then what does it matter what other people think.  Decide for yourself.......I wouldn't stay in business if I let them buy something ugly because they are my walking advertisements.  It's such a touchy business when it comes to family and friends, I often have to "bite my tongue".   When did we get so dependent on what others think?  Let's be individuals and wear what we like.......Life's too short to wear borin glasses!
